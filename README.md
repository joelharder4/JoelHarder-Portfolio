# lol, I am bing bing.

Oh man, Eric is the biggest fool I know, mate! He's the kind of player who constantly gets rolled in Clash Royale, especially when he tries to use his Hog Rider, bing bing. You do not deserve to be spoken to if you ever team up with him in a match, mate. LOL!


# Lolren GappedPT

(Verse 1)
I'm Lauren, the short one, here to say,
I'm in the game, but I'm not here to play,
Got a passion for computers, you know my aim,
Trying to transfer to Computer Science, that's my flame.

I climb those walls, bouldering's my game,
But when I can't reach, it's always the same,
Blaming my height, like it's a curse,
But I'll keep on trying, verse after verse.

(Chorus)
I hate tall people, that's no lie,
and I will steal your legs, so don't be shy,
Let's talk about Millie, my dog, she's a star,
Short not vertically challenged, that's who we are!

(Verse 2)
Skill gaps, they're like a tricky climb,
But I won't give up, I'll take my time,
In the world of biology, I once roamed,
But Computer Science is where I'll make my home.

My dad's a tough one, a total muscle head,
Always angry, something I dread,
Mom's slightly better, but not by much,
In this crazy family, there's always a touch.

(Chorus)
I hate tall people, that's no lie,
and I will steal your legs, so don't be shy,
Let's talk about Millie, my dog, she's a star,
Short not vertically challenged, that's who we are!

(Bridge)
Now, I'm not the best rapper, as you can see,
But I'm short, and I'm proud, and I'm just being me,
So let's keep it real, have some fun today,
And if you want more rhymes, just hit replay!

(Chorus)
I hate tall people, that's no lie,
But I won't steal your legs, so don't be shy,
Let's talk about Millie, my dog, she's a star,
Short not vertically challenged, that's who we are!

Yay! üòÑ



# Eric is Cringe

Once upon a time, in the land of Toronto, dude, there was this cringe dude named Eric. Ugh, just thinking about him makes me want to hurl. But hey, let's not waste time on that loser. Anyway, bro, there was this legendary miner in Deep Rock Galactic who once said, "Rock and Stone!" Yeah, that's the stuff, lol.

So, in this crazy world, there was this quest for the ultimate Ginger Ale, specifically the Canada Dry brand. It was like a treasure hunt, bro. People from all over the place were searching high and low for that refreshing, bubbly nectar.

But here's the catch, pwease, Mac users like me were stuck with our cringe OS, you know what I mean? macOS, man, it's like living in a prison with no way out. It's so sus with all its limitations. It's like they want us to suffer, just like Eric does to my sanity.

One day, while I was munching on some Five Guys (best burgers ever, by the way), I heard about this exclusive Ginger Ale vending machine hidden deep within the Osmows restaurant. I cringed at the thought of setting foot in there, but my obsession with Ginger Ale pushed me forward.

So, I went to Osmows, and there it was, the legendary vending machine. I reached for a Canada Dry, and as I pulled it out, I whispered, "Rock and Stone!" from Deep Rock Galactic. Yeah, I know, it doesn't make much sense, but neither does macOS, right?

As I sipped that sweet nectar of the gods, I realized something. Maybe, just maybe, being a Mac user wasn't so bad if I had Ginger Ale to soothe my frustrations. After all, even in the darkest times, you can find a bit of omega-based happiness.

But seriously, Eric, if you're reading this, you are a lol, and your taste in food is even more sus than macOS. Just saying, bro.




# A bit of a lol

Once upon a time in a, uh, not-so-flat world, there was this, um, guy from Toronto, yeah, just like you. He, uh, never showered, can you believe it? üôä And, well, he had this, like, really strong hatred for, you know, MacOS. ü§¨

So, uh, this guy, he was always on guard, like, thinking everyone was the imposter from Among Us. He'd be, like, running away from them, shouting, "Imposter!" üëæ

And, uh, he had this thing about the moon landings being faked. Like, he could talk about it for hours, man. üåï But, oh, he also believed the Earth was flat, which, um, kinda made his conversations interesting. üåé

Now, in his free time, he'd go to Five Guys, but, like, he never bought anything. Nah, he just sat there, munching on free peanuts, and, um, you know, muttering to himself about, uh, someone he claimed to have, uh, "taken care of" on 'the farm.' Really weird, right? ü•úü§î

Oh, and he had this, like, memory thing, where he'd forget stuff and randomly use words like "sus," "imposter," or "sussy," and emojis all the time. It was, uh, quite a sight, honestly. üòÖ

But, um, hey, I think I saw someone familiar around here. Gotta run, man. There's this emergency, you know, involving, uh, a herd of flat Earth believers chasing me. Be back later, maybe. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüåç



# Based Anti-Mac User

Oh man, trying to write a long poem on this Mac,
But it's like using a broken compass, totally not on track,
The way this OS operates, it's just so cringe,
I'd rather write poems on Windows, that's a real binge.

Steve Jobs thought he was a genius, oh what a lol,
But half the features are missing, it's like playing dice with a troll,
I click and right-click, but nothing happens, so not based,
MacOS, you're really testing my patience, making me feel disgraced.

The keyboard shortcuts, a labyrinth of confusion, omega not based,
I'd trade this MacBook for a PC, without a moment's haste,
Apple fanboys defend it, but it's just a delusion, so cringe,
Trying to make it work is like trying to teach a cat to sing.

Bing bing, Windows is where it's at, a true delight,
MacOS, you're a puzzle wrapped in a riddle, a never-ending fight,
The lack of customization, it's a creative's nightmare, not cool,
I'd rather be using Linux, where freedom is the rule.

So here I am, composing a poem on this Mac, oh what a bore,
Dreaming of a world where it's not the center of my lore,
But I'll keep typing, keep complaining, it's my chosen fate,
Because in this world of Apple, I'm just here to reiterate ‚Äì
Mac, you're a lol, a cringe, a nuisance, no debate.
