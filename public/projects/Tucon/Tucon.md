## About this Project

The goal of this project was to give University students a fast and intuitive platform to discover tutors or be discovered as a tutor.

This is the final project for the course *CIS\*3750* at the University of Guelph, which is a course focused on learning the entire Software Development process starting from thinking of an idea, to planning, designing, and then finally implementation and reflection.

### The Problem
Many University students have struggled in a class and tried looking for tutors or wanted to tutor others for a little extra income during the semester to help pay the rising cost of living. The current method promoted for matching students with tutors at the University of Guelph consists of a public Microsoft Excel sheet where a tutor must post each class they want to tutor for. Students must then manually search for a tutor and hope that this list is still up to date. This solution is both complicated to use, unintuitive, and not easily discoverable.

### The Solution
The lack of an easy-to-use, intuitive platform for connecting students and tutors from the University of Guelph motivated myself and the Tutor Connect team to make Tucon. Tucon provides an easy-to-use and intuitive interface to match tutors with students at the University of Guelph. A new user can easily create a new account and either set up a tutor or student profile, depending on if they need to find a tutor or if they want to offer some tutoring services. Our system then utilizes a matching algorithm, using the information from your profile, to determine who the best tutors are for you. These tutors are displayed in a Tinder-like style to enable a quick snapshot of all the relevant information needed to determine if the person seems like a good fit or not. Once a match occurs, the integrated messaging platform can be used to easily schedule tutoring sessions and discuss payments. Overall, this platform provides a simpler and more convenient method for matching students and tutors at the University of Guelph.

## The Software Design Process
In addition to developing a final product that I am very proud of, I learned the various steps that should be taken to develop complete and effective software. The steps that we followed are as follows:

1\. Create User Stories to get an idea of what the various users want to be able to do. an example of a User Story would be: "As a Student, I want to be able to match with a Tutor of my choice."

2\. Create Requirements based on the user stories. Requirements are very beneficial because they establish what that the system will, might (depending on the amount of development time), or will not do. A requirement can have different priorities like must, should, could, or wont. An example would be "The Student User must be able to match with a Tutor." Coming up with requirements that everyone on the team agreed upon took the most amount of time, but once it was finished we were all on the same page and the rest of the steps were very smooth and quick because of it.

3\. Create Tasks based on a combination of the requirements and user stories. Each task is one individual job like "create a button for X" that can be assigned to a person to complete, similar to a ticket system. Tasks are given a time estimate and any dependencies which is used in the future for planning the order at which things should be developed. In order to come up with the time estimates for each task, my team and I played 'planning poker' where we each choose a card to say how long we think it will take, and then discuss and come to an agreement if there are large differences.

4\. Make a Timeline that puts all of the tasks in order so that all dependencies of any task comes before it, and also so that every person always has something to work on at the same time.

5\. Come up with a prototype and consult with potential users to get feedback. For this step, we make a paper prototype and had other university students come and test it. We recorded their feedback during the prototype sessions and made appropriate changes to our final design based on that.

6\. By now, we have a very high level of understanding on what our product should have and should look like, so it was time to implement it. We had a little over two weeks worth of time (keep in mind we all had lots of other courses at the same time) to program the final product before we had to demo it to the rest of the class.


## Features
### Landing Page
Here is the landing page of our website. From here you have the ability to see more About us, Log in to an existing account, or create a new account by Signing up.

### Create Profile
I was the sole developer who worked on the create profile pages. It provides visually appealing and self explanitory forms to create a student or a tutor profile, depending on what you want to be.

### Match Page
The match page serves as the main feature for students and it allows them to find a tutor. It provides an image along with a quick summary of the relevant information. If the student is interested but not completely sure, they have the option to click on the profile to see full details about them.

## Additional Information

As of writing this (May 27, 2024), Tucon is not a completely functioning product, but instead is a high fidelety prototype.
