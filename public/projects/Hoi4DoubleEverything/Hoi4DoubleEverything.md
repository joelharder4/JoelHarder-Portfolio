## Background

Hearts of Iron IV is a grand strategy wargame that takes place during World War II. You take control of a nation from the time period, build up industrial and military power, establish aliances, and even offers non-fiction alternative history options. The amount of depth to the game can be intimidating to new players, but it's also what I love about it. The best part is that every single feature in it can be modded to add, change, or completely overhaul the game. This is one of the many mods that I have made for Hearts of Iron IV, and I only plan to make more in the future!

## Features

The purpose of this mod is to push the in game bonuses to the extreme. Every modifier that the player recieves from focuses, country leaders, events, politcal advisors, doctrines, and more are all **doubled**. This makes the game more interesting because any bonuses that you get are twice as good, but the tradeoff is that any negative debuffs are also doubled.

## Examples

Anyone who is familiar with hoi4 will know that at the start of the game, the United States has extremely large penalties from The Great Depression and this mod only makes it worse. With the changes from the mod, the USA wont have any recruitable manpower, they wont be earning politcal power, and all of their factories will be assigned to consumer goods which means they wont be able to construct anything. Thankfully, the Great Depression can be removed eventually, but it is a major setback for the United States and makes the game much more difficult if you are looking for a challenge.

If you want an extra hard challenge, use the game settings to strengthen a country, and watch them swarm you with their **-100%** supply consumption, **+100%** political power, **-100%** lack of resources penalty, and more!
