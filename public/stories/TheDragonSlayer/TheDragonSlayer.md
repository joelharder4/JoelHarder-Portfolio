Since May 2023, I’ve been playing a Dungeons & Dragons character named Zyvan Woodfoot. Technically, that’s his name. But if you call him anything other than "Zyvan the Dragon Slayer," he will loudly and confidently correct you. He carries himself like a legendary hero from a fairy tale, completely convinced that dragons are responsible for every evil in the world. Disease? Dragon's curse. Got mugged? The thief must have been hired by the dragons. Your dog ran away? A dragon ate it. He is so sure of his mission that reality rarely has a say in the matter. 

Zyvan is a wood elf who was 80 years old at the start of his adventure, which for an elf is still fairly young. Despite that, he speaks with the self-importance of someone who has lived through a dozen wars and written books about all of them. He has the energy of someone who has waited his whole life for a spotlight, and now that he’s in it, he’s never stepping out.

One of the most important things to know about Zyvan is that He has the confidence of a seasoned war hero, and the intelligence of a soggy stick. His Intelligence score is a 7. That’s a -2 modifier. There is no question, no debate, no spin that can make him sound smart. He is not clever. He is not insightful. But that doesn’t stop him from contributing ideas with complete confidence. In fact, he might be the most eager person in the party to speak up and offer “brilliant” plans. Most of them are terrible. All of them are delivered as if they are absolute genius. His cluelessness isn’t something I play around or try to hide. It’s one of his best traits, and he leans into it with so much enthusiasm that you almost want to believe him.

His backstory started in the Great Greenwood, where he grew up surrounded by peace, tradition, and ancient wisdom. Most elves in that environment become scholars or artists or careful adventurers. Zyvan found a book called Legends of the Dragon Slayers buried in a dusty archive and misread it so badly that it changed his life. He believed the stories were real, that they spoke directly to him, and that he was fated to join their ranks. That belief never wavered. Even when his friends set up a prank involving a crumbling dragon-shaped statue in a nearby cavern, Zyvan charged it headfirst with a wooden sword, convinced it was a real dragon frozen in time. He declared victory after “slaying” it and took it as a sign that his journey had truly begun.

As he got older, Zyvan’s delusions only grew. He started telling stories about adventures that never happened, many of which were actually dreams he had. He genuinely cannot tell the difference between a memory and a dream. If he dreams that he rescued a princess from a dragon's lair in an active volcano, he will wake up and add it to his growing list of heroic deeds. His tales often start with “Of course, you’ve heard of the time I single-handedly dismantled the Cult of the Dragons,” even though no one has, and probably because it never happened.

One of my favorite moments playing Zyvan happened during our very first session. We were in a small village that was being threatened by a creeping corruption spreading from nearby ruins. A dark wizard had recently gone missing, and things were clearly about to get worse. Zyvan decided that the village needed to evacuate and that he would be the one to convince them. He stood in the center of town and gave a passionate, way-too-long speech blaming the entire crisis on dragons. He went on about ancient threats and rising flames and bloodlines of fire, and when he finished, I rolled for persuasion. Natural 20. Every single villager believed him. The whole town started preparing to evacuate because one delusional elf told them a bedtime story with enough confidence to move mountains. It was perfect.

What makes Zyvan even funnier is that over the course of the campaign, he has actually proven himself to be the heroic warrior he always claimed to be. He has fought well, protected people, taken risks, and survived things that would’ve destroyed less confident characters. And none of that changed his personality. He was loud, dramatic, and convinced of his greatness well before the adventure started, and he is still all of those things now. The only difference is that now, his stories are true, and the rest of the party was there to witness them. He still tells them with the same over-the-top flair as before. He just finally has real material to work with.

He is also, despite all odds, surprisingly competent in the field. He’s sneaky when he needs, is astonishingly accurate with a bow and arrow, and has become deadly in combat situations. But that doesn’t stop him from constantly misunderstanding the world around him or confidently misinterpreting events. That’s just who he is.

When I play Zyvan, I give him a ridiculous voice. It’s this over-the-top, theatrical nerd tone, and I often start his lines with “Umm akccutuallyy,” followed by something completely and utterly wrong. It sets the tone immediately, and the party always knows when Zyvan is about to derail a conversation with something he thinks is insightful. Playing him is hilarious, unpredictable, and oddly rewarding.

I think the reason I enjoy playing Zyvan so much is because he is the complete opposite of me. In real life, I’m usually more quiet, more cautious about speaking up, and less likely to take the spotlight. Zyvan doesn’t hesitate. He jumps into every conversation. He makes his voice heard, even when it shouldn’t be. Playing him pushes me to get out of my comfort zone. If a situation comes up where I wouldn’t normally speak, I have to remind myself that Zyvan would. And then I go for it. That part of the experience has been surprisingly fun and kind of freeing.

Zyvan the Dragon Slayer is delusional, loud, misguided, and wrong about almost everything. But he’s also brave, loyal, and determined. He shows up, puts everything on the line, and truly believes he’s making the world a better place. Playing him has reminded me that confidence can be more important than correctness, and that sometimes, charging into a situation with full belief in yourself is better than sitting back and waiting to be sure. He’s taught me to speak up more, take chances, and lean into the things that make a character (or a person) unique, even if they don’t always make sense.
