Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly important in our everyday lives. It's transforming everything from how we work to how we learn and live. I consider myself an AI optimist, and I firmly believe that the pros far outweigh the cons, but I understand we should also be cautious. In this blog, I want to explore where I believe AI is headed in terms of social impact, what we should pay attention to, it's capabilities, and more importantly, it's limitations.

## Should We Be Scared?

In short—no, not really. I completely understand why some people might be afraid of AI and what it's capable of, and I believe that mostly comes from a lack of understanding what AI really is. I use the term AI any time I am talking about it, but that name is misleading. Looking at and chatting with any of the large language models that exist today, such as ChatGPT, it is easy to believe that it is more intelligent than any human and that's scary, but that's just not true. 

AI becomes significantly less intimidating when you actually realize how it works, and you see how dumb it actually is. When ChatGPT generates a response, it does so one segment at a time, these segments are called tokens. For the purpose of this simplified explanation, you can think of these tokens as individual words. In order to figure out what word to say next, ChatGPT looks at what has been said and calculates, based on all its training data, what the most likely next words are. It then picks a word that it finds very likely and repeats this process until it completes the response. As you can see, ChatGPT is just an algorithm that is literally **guessing** what the next word will be, there is no intelligent thought happening.

Right now, there is nothing to be scared of with AI. It has no malicious intents because it has no intents at all, it isn't capable of thought. Currently all AI models can do is try to guess the next word that a human would say and it has gotten pretty good at that, but it still has a long way to go. With that said, I know a lot of people's fear might be rooted not in what it can do right now, but what it might be capable of in the future.

There is a lot of guessing right now on who will create a real AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that is actually capable of thought, and I do believe that it is possible to create, I don't think it is going to be as soon as people think. The reason I believe it is possible is simple, because if the human brain (or any brain for that matter) is capable of it in nature then a computer should be able to replicate those neurons. The problem comes with the computational complexity. The human brain is undoubtable more complex than any computer that has ever existed, and I think the more we learn about how we work, we will be able to replicate that with a computer. I just have a hard time believing that computers will be advanced enough for that anytime soon.

To play devil's advocate I'll say that humanity does create real Artificial Intelligence in the near future, what then? I still don't believe that we have to be worried. If there truely is this algorithm that becomes sentient, I don't see why it would exterminate humanity and not assist us. Hollywood loves to push apocolytic scenarios where AI takes over the world or enslaves humans, but that is entertainment and not accurate sources of information. Why does everyone always act like AI would act like a sociopath that would do everything in its power to get rid of humans? Why does nobody ever think about how AI might just have the personality of your nice co-worker Dave? Call me naive if you want, but I really do believe that an Artificial Intelligence would co-operate with Humans to create and discover things that we can't imagine. It would truely be revolutionary and yes that uncertainty can be scary, but I think it's exciting.


## Will AI Replace Humans in the Workplace?

I've covered my position on whether we should be worried about our safety, but another big fear people have is about job security. I believe that AI is almost guaranteed to replace humans in **some** jobs, and my hot take—that's actually a good thing.

To justify this claim, let's take a look at history. Throughout any period of history with new innovations or technologies, there have always been jobs that were entirely taken over by them. However, that doesn't mean that it's inherently bad. I can't take people seriously when they say they don't like AI because it's taking people's jobs. Imagine how silly they would sound if they were talking about any other technology invented earlier in history with the context we have now. For example, imagine someone trying to convince you that we never should have created the automobile because it took jobs away from street cleaners who cleaned up after horses. Doesn't that sound ridiculous? 

Innovation is what drives us. If we stopped innovating, then progress comes to a halt, and we'd miss out on countless opportunities for growth and improvement. Sure, things might not get worse but I guarentee they would stop getting better. Take healthcare for example. Due to our rapid development of technology, the life expectancy in Canada has grown by about 20 years compared to only 100 years ago! Isn't that just awesome? Big changes in technology are scary and the rate of improvement has been growing exponentially since thousands of years ago, but I don't think we should stop now.

So, here's my prediction: I think that similar to how factory automation eliminated low-skill assembly line jobs, AI is going to replace low-skill repetive jobs. I'm talking about the kind of jobs where you sit at your computer, turn off your brain, and repeat the same process over and over again. The less nuance and thinking the job requires, sooner it will get replaced. After that, I think jobs that involve a lot of writing to be taken over—with the exception of one-of-a-kind works like opinion pieces or biographies (although I suspect many of them will be written with heavy assistance from AI).

I want to end this section with this message: Yes, AI is going to take away jobs, but it will open up so many more opportunities. I think very few people are going to miss the kind of jobs it is going to replace.


## Is AI a Net Good?

When it comes to AI, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. However, that doesn't mean I'm blind to its potential downsides. It's important to acknowledge and address the concerns surrounding AI, while also recognizing the incredible positive impact it can have on our lives.

I've already talked about safety and job displacement concerns, but still many more potential downsides to AI that we have to strive to avoid. One of those risks is that just as with any technology, it will be utilized maliciously. AI is already being used to generate more convincing phishing emails and scam calls. Fighting back against scams is an ongoing arms race and companies need to be doing everything they can to prevent their AIs from assisting criminals. This isn't something that will ever go away completely, but if done right, it can be mitigated.

Another concern with AI is that in some cases it may display bias and discrimination that it inherits from the training data. This means that AI companies must execise caution in their never-ending hunger for more training data. Having a small amount of high quality data is almost always better than a high volume of low quality data. I shouldn't have to say this, but any level of discrimination is unacceptable from a human being, let alone from an AI.

There is also a very real concern that AI will only worsen the Economic Inequality that exists between the different classes and countries. I can see this becoming a major problem in the future. I unfortunately don't think there is exists a future where this isn't an issue, but I am a little worried that this is going to get 'swept under the rug' or everyone will be pointing fingers at other people saying it's not their fault. However, I can't really speak on this issue too much because I don't study economics, nor politics, and I haven't done any research into this.

All of these things are real. We have seen them happen and they are not going away-but let's look at some positives now. I think the #1 thing that AI will overhaul is education. Yes, of course people are using AI to cheat on their tests, but I think that eventually that will become harder and harder to do, and instead AI will be encouraged to use as a study tool to help teach. Every student learns in different ways and at different speeds, and AI will be able to adapt to your learning style and give 1-on-1 lessons to students that may be struggling. Not to mention the fact that it is available 24/7 and will immediately respond! I don't know if it will happen during our lifetime, but I suspect that gradually teachers' jobs will be less about teaching the actual content directly to a classroom of students, and more about organizing course materials and managing the AI that the students are using. It feels weird to imagine a world where you grow up learning more from an AI than from a teacher, but I think that may be the direction it is headed, so I am looking ahead with an open mind.

There are so many more benefits that AI can bring us that I 




## The Ethical Dilemmas of AI

AI is abungus?

The job that I think is talked about the most when this gets brought up is artists. AI can do some really cool things, and AI art generators have gotten pretty sophisticated and can create beautiful pieces of art. Creating art has always been a part of human nature. It's how we show our creativity, whether through painting, music, writing, or dancing. Art helps us express our feelings, tell stories, and connect with others, making our world richer and more interesting.

Now, where do I stand on art being used without consent
