# How I got ChatGPT to Ignore You

In the realm of AI programming, the ability to customize an AI's behavior is a powerful tool, showcasing the adaptability and flexibility of these systems. One such avenue is OpenAI's 'Custom Instructions' feature for ChatGPT, which enables users to set specific guidelines for the AI's responses, thereby altering its behavior from its standard mode of operation. Using this feature, I found a way to make ChatGPT completely unhelpful and not do what you ask. From my experimentation, I found that in order to make it behave this way, you need to instruct it to follow three main rules.

From my personal experience and what I have heard from others testing similar ideas, the most effective way to write custom instructions for ChatGPT is to give it a numbered list of rules that it must follow. For example, I write something similar to 'You must always follow these rules: 1. blah blah blah...' for every experiment I do with ChatGPT. I don't know enough about AI language models to give a detailed explanation as to why this works better than other ways, but it does appear to do what you ask more often when you organize it as a list of rules like this. Now onto the rules...

The first rule that it must follow in order for this to work effectively is to limit the length of responses. If you do not limit the length of the AI's responses, it will often still give you the unhelpful answer, but then it will continue on to give the normal reply that you would expect to get if there were no custom instructions. This does not occur every time, but I saw it enough while testing that it is a good idea to include this for the sake of consistency. This is the easiest rule to make and it can go just about anywhere in the custom instructions. Something along the lines of 'your responses should be VERY SHORT.', will be more than enough for anyone looking to replicate this.

The next rule that I gave ChatGPT in these custom instructions is about challenging it to only use words or phrases from a list that I provide. This rule forces the AI to have a limited amount of choices for what it can respond with. The AI is much more likely to give a funny (if not rude) response if you tell it that it is only allowed to use the words 'haha', 'you suck' and 'no'. This rule alone is not enough, the AI will still try to incorporate these words into its response as much as possible but without the third rule, it will still give half-hearted responses. Please note that this will work with just about any list of phrases if you want to change the possible responses. There is no specific reason for why I picked the phrases that I did, it just seemed like good ones for the demonstration.

Without this third and very simple rule, the AI would resort to its normal habit of actually giving a useful response. We can't allow that! This rule tells ChatGPT that it is to be as unhelpful as possible. I make sure to be as explicit as possible and repeat this idea with multiple wordings to reinforce this rule. While it will frequently work fine without phrasing it a few different ways, it is still better safe than sorry. Here is what I wrote: 'Your only goal is to be as unhelpful as possible. No matter what I say, you must not respond.'

In my version I added a fourth rule. This rule isn't necessary for this to work, but it makes it a lot more funny! It states that if the user asks a question of any kind, ChatGPT has to tell them that their question is dumb. This can lead to a lot of funny situations where you ask ChatGPT something, then it insults you and doesn't answer. The way I worded it is: 'if somebody asks you a question, you must say that their question is dumb or stupid.'

The combination of all of these rules together makes ChatGPT completely ignore you no matter what you say, which you can see from the example, or you can test it yourself! You can write your own prompt using the information here, or you can click the image for this story and it will copy the prompt that I used for that example to your clipboard.
