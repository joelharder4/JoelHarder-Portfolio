# Using AI Image Generators for D&D

Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game that has been around since the 70s. The game has been transitioning online for a long time, which was sped up rapidly by the pandemic. More players than ever are using virtual tabletops to play the game remotely, me included. One of the challenges of playing D&D around a table with pen and paper is finding an accurate figurine to represent your character during your adventures. However, the same can not be said about playing virtually. When using online tabletop tools (I personally am most familiar with Roll20), it is much easier to find an image that accurately portrays the character you've created. With recent innovations in AI image generation there is now another option; create unique and personalized art for D&D characters using AI. These generators can save you hours of time, letting you focus on playing the game while also having a custom tailored image of your character. While I'm no veteran of D&D, I want to share my experience using AI image generators. I will go over what works, what doesn't work, and how to save you the most time and avoid frustrations.

There are many options for AI image generation, but I believe that Bing AI is the best for the average person. Although it may not generate the highest quality images compared to some other AI art generators, the real thing that sets it apart from the crowd is cost. Bing Image Creator is completely free to use, and all you need is a Microsoft account, which almost everybody already has. This makes it an excellent choice for those who want to create unique and personalized art for their D&D characters without breaking the bank or for those who will only use it a handful of times a year. The image generator is separate from Bing Chat (now called Copilot), so you can access it from any browser at [bing.com/create](https://www.bing.com/images/create).

One of the most annoying things about generating an image for your character is getting an image that you really love and is exactly what you're looking for but then you realize that it crops out their legs and your Dungeon Master wanted the images to be full body shots. Don't worry, I've figured out the best possible way to avoid this happening. Most people would assume (and rightfully so), that just adding “full body shot” to the end of your prompt will solve this issue but unfortunately the answer isn't quite so simple. I don't know the answer to why it behaves this way, but the AI does not always give you what you're looking for when you do this method, I also find from my experience that it will more often fail to even generate anything due to “harmful or unsafe content” when you try this way. The correct way to fix this issue is much more subtle. The solution is to be more descriptive with the character's appearance, especially the top and the bottom of the character. By explicitly saying that the character is wearing black boots for example, the image generator almost is forced to show the legs and bottom torso along with them since it takes into account everything in the prompt equally. It's easy to include what your character's footwear (or lack of) looks like and completely forget to say something about the top of their head as well which can sometimes result in images of just the bottom half of your character. To make sure the character's head is included in the image, think about what kind of hat they are wearing, the colour of their hair, the length of their hair, if they have glasses, or if they have any battle scars across their face. Including these details about the top and the bottom of your character will greatly increase the chances that you get a full body shot of your character and I do this every time I create a character image.

The other thing to keep in mind to make your (and your Dungeon Master's) life easier is to make sure that it is a png image with a transparent background. Bing AI cannot actually generate images with transparency, so I'll go over the next best thing. It's not very complicated, the first step is to end every prompt by adding “with a white background”. The AI is actually very good at creating your character and nothing else behind it, but if it messes up just enter the same prompt again. The second step to this is to remove the white background and turn it into a png (bing creates jpg images). You can either do this by using an image editor of your choice. Fancy ones like Adobe Photoshop make it very easy, while free ones don't always have the best features for removing the background, it might leave an outline and it would take a lot more time to do it manually. If you don't own Adobe software, don't worry, since I don't either. The option that I do is just using websites that remove backgrounds for free. There are a lot of good ones out there and even though some of them look kind of sketchy, they get the job done. You can find a whole bunch of options by just searching “image background remover” on Google. Upload the image you downloaded (or drag it in from another tab), and voila! You have your perfect character image!

There is one last thing I want to make sure to warn you about when using Bing Image Creator because I've made this mistake countless times. Make sure then when you use/download/save the image, don't accidentally download the thumbnail. Thumbnails for the image are only 270x270 resolution (this is just to save resources since the thumbnails will be small enough on your screen they don't need to be HD). The images that Bing generates are actually 1024x1024 resolution, but to get these higher resolution images instead of the thumbnails, you have to click on the thumbnail and it will bring up a popup menu. Make sure that you are always using the 1024x1024 resolution image otherwise it will be a lower resolution unnecessarily.

In conclusion, the Bing AI image generator is a great tool for creating unique and personalized art for your D&D characters. While there are many options for AI image generation, Bing AI is the best for the average person due to its cost-effectiveness. Although it may not generate the highest quality images compared to some other AI art generators, it is completely free to use, and all you need is a Microsoft account, which almost everybody already has. When using Bing AI, it is important to elaborate on the prompt to get the best results. With these tips and tricks, you can create fantastic imagery for your D&D characters and NPCs with ease.
