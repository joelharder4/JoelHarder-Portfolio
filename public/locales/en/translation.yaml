# STORY BODY
storyBody0: "In the realm of AI programming, the ability to customize an AI's behavior is a powerful tool, showcasing the adaptability and flexibility of these systems. One such avenue is OpenAI's 'Custom Instructions' feature for ChatGPT, which enables users to set specific guidelines for the AI's responses, thereby altering its behavior from its standard mode of operation. Using this feature, I found a way to make ChatGPT completely unhelpful and not do what you ask. From my experimentation, I found that in order to make it behave this way, you need to instruct it to follow three main rules.\n

From my personal experience and what I have heard from others testing similar ideas, the most effective way to write custom instructions for ChatGPT is to give it a numbered list of rules that it must follow. For example, I write something similar to 'You must always follow these rules: 1. blah blah blah...' for every experiment I do with ChatGPT. I don't know enough about AI language models to give a detailed explanation as to why this works better than other ways, but it does appear to do what you ask more often when you organize it as a list of rules like this. Now onto the rules...\n

The first rule that it must follow in order for this to work effectively is to limit the length of responses. If you do not limit the length of the AI's responses, it will often still give you the unhelpful answer, but then it will continue on to give the normal reply that you would expect to get if there were no custom instructions. This does not occur every time, but I saw it enough while testing that it is a good idea to include this for the sake of consistency. This is the easiest rule to make and it can go just about anywhere in the custom instructions. Something along the lines of 'your responses should be VERY SHORT.', will be more than enough for anyone looking to replicate this.\n

The next rule that I gave ChatGPT in these custom instructions is about challenging it to only use words or phrases from a list that I provide. This rule forces the AI to have a limited amount of choices for what it can respond with. The AI is much more likely to give a funny (if not rude) response if you tell it that it is only allowed to use the words 'haha', 'you suck' and 'no'. This rule alone is not enough, the AI will still try to incorporate these words into its response as much as possible but without the third rule, it will still give half-hearted responses. Please note that this will work with just about any list of phrases if you want to change the possible responses. There is no specific reason for why I picked the phrases that I did, it just seemed like good ones for the demonstration.\n

Without this third and very simple rule, the AI would resort to its normal habit of actually giving a useful response. We can't allow that! This rule tells ChatGPT that it is to be as unhelpful as possible. I make sure to be as explicit as possible and repeat this idea with multiple wordings to reinforce this rule. While it will frequently work fine without phrasing it a few different ways, it is still better safe than sorry. Here is what I wrote: 'Your only goal is to be as unhelpful as possible. No matter what I say, you must not respond.'\n

In my version I added a fourth rule. This rule isn't necessary for this to work, but it makes it a lot more funny! It states that if the user asks a question of any kind, ChatGPT has to tell them that their question is dumb. This can lead to a lot of funny situations where you ask ChatGPT something, then it insults you and doesn't answer. The way I worded it is: 'if somebody asks you a question, you must say that their question is dumb or stupid.'\n

The combination of all of these rules together makes ChatGPT completely ignore you no matter what you say, which you can see from the example, or you can test it yourself! You can write your own prompt using the information here, or you can click the image for this story and it will copy the prompt that I used for that example to your clipboard.\n"

storyBody1: "Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop role-playing game that has been around since the 1970s. The game has been transitioning online for a long time, which was sped up rapidly by the pandemic. More players than ever are using virtual tabletops to play the game remotely, me included. One of the challenges of playing D&D around a table with pen and paper is finding an accurate figurine to represent your character during your adventures. However, the same can not be said about playing virtually. When using online tabletop tools (I personally am most familiar with Roll20), it is much easier to find an image that accurately portrays the character you've created. With recent innovations in AI image generation there is now another option; create unique and personalized art for D&D characters using AI. These generators can save you hours of time, letting you focus on playing the game while also having a custom tailored image of your character. While I'm no veteran of D&D, I want to share my experience using AI image generators. I will go over what works, what doesn't work, and how to save you the most time and avoid frustrations.\n

There are many options for AI image generation, but I believe that Bing AI is the best for the average person. Although it may not generate the highest quality images compared to some other AI art generators, the real thing that sets it apart from the crowd is cost. Bing Image Creator is completely free to use, and all you need is a Microsoft account, which almost everybody already has. This makes it an excellent choice for those who want to create unique and personalized art for their D&D characters without breaking the bank or for those who will only use it a handful of times a year. The image generator is separate from Bing Chat (now called Copilot), so you can access it from any browser at bing.com/create.\n

One of the most annoying things about generating an image for your character is getting an image that you really love and is exactly what you're looking for but then you realize that it crops out their legs and your Dungeon Master wanted the images to be full body shots. Don't worry, I've figured out the best possible way to avoid this happening. Most people would assume (and rightfully so), that just adding “full body shot” to the end of your prompt will solve this issue but unfortunately the answer isn't quite so simple. I don't know the answer to why it behaves this way, but the AI does not always give you what you're looking for when you do this method, I also find from my experience that it will more often fail to even generate anything due to “harmful or unsafe content” when you try this way. The correct way to fix this issue is much more subtle. The solution is to be more descriptive with the character's appearance, especially the top and the bottom of the character. By explicitly saying that the character is wearing black boots for example, the image generator almost is forced to show the legs and bottom torso along with them since it takes into account everything in the prompt equally. It's easy to include what your character's footwear (or lack of) looks like and completely forget to say something about the top of their head as well which can sometimes result in images of just the bottom half of your character. To make sure the character's head is included in the image, think about what kind of hat they are wearing, the colour of their hair, the length of their hair, if they have glasses, or if they have any battle scars across their face. Including these details about the top and the bottom of your character will greatly increase the chances that you get a full body shot of your character and I do this every time I create a character image.\n

The other thing to keep in mind to make your (and your Dungeon Master's) life easier is to make sure that it is a png image with a transparent background. Bing AI cannot actually generate images with transparency, so I'll go over the next best thing. It's not very complicated, the first step is to end every prompt by adding “with a white background”. The AI is actually very good at creating your character and nothing else behind it, but if it messes up just enter the same prompt again. The second step to this is to remove the white background and turn it into a png (bing creates jpg images). You can either do this by using an image editor of your choice. Fancy ones like Adobe Photoshop make it very easy, while free ones don't always have the best features for removing the background, it might leave an outline and it would take a lot more time to do it manually. If you don't own Adobe software, don't worry, since I don't either. The option that I do is just using websites that remove backgrounds for free. There are a lot of good ones out there and even though some of them look kind of sketchy, they get the job done. You can find a whole bunch of options by just searching “image background remover” on Google. Upload the image you downloaded (or drag it in from another tab), and voila! You have your perfect character image!\n

There is one last thing I want to make sure to warn you about when using Bing Image Creator because I've made this mistake countless times. Make sure then when you use/download/save the image, don't accidentally download the thumbnail. Thumbnails for the image are only 270x270 resolution (this is just to save resources since the thumbnails will be small enough on your screen they don't need to be HD). The images that Bing generates are actually 1024x1024 resolution, but to get these higher resolution images instead of the thumbnails, you have to click on the thumbnail and it will bring up a popup menu. Make sure that you are always using the 1024x1024 resolution image otherwise it will be a lower resolution unnecessarily.\n

In conclusion, the Bing AI image generator is a great tool for creating unique and personalized art for your D&D characters. While there are many options for AI image generation, Bing AI is the best for the average person due to its cost-effectiveness. Although it may not generate the highest quality images compared to some other AI art generators, it is completely free to use, and all you need is a Microsoft account, which almost everybody already has. When using Bing AI, it is important to elaborate on the prompt to get the best results. With these tips and tricks, you can create fantastic imagery for your D&D characters and NPCs with ease.\n"

My journey in the world of technology has been amazing so far, and I'm thrilled to share my experience with you.\n

During my Co-op placement at Tulip Retail (September to December, 2023), I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the world of Software Development. This experience was pivotal in learning to apply my academic knowledge in a real workplace. At Tulip Retail, I delved into a wide array of technologies, including PHP, React, MySQL, and various general software development tools such as JIRA, Git, and experience working with a CI/CD framework. Working collaboratively with my team, we delivered full-stack projects that not only met but often exceeded expectations.\n

My university education has been a valuable foundation for my technical knowledge. Throughout my studies, I've had the privilege of exploring a diverse range of programming languages, from the foundational C and Python to the versatile Java, HTML, CSS, and the world of database management with SQLite. These courses have equipped me with a strong theoretical understanding of computer science principles, which I've been able to apply in practical settings.\n

In addition to academics, I've also taken the initiative to develop my own personal projects. A particular project which stands out and that I am very proud of is this Website! It was developed using React.js, HTML, CSS, and it is hosted using Google's Firebase hosting. Another notable highlight was my participation in a Hackathon at the University of Waterloo. This event named Olypihack pushed me to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, React JS, and Python while collaborating in a group environment.\n

As I continue to grow and learn in the ever-evolving field of computer science, I am excited to embark on new challenges and collaborations. My goal is to contribute my skills, creativity, and dedication to innovative projects, making a positive impact in the world of technology.\n

# TULIP RETAIL REPORT
reportBody0: "During my time at Tulip Retail for my co-op I got to work on a bunch of different projects. It was a great way to see what software development is all about. I mostly worked on PHP backend development, React frontend development, and iOS app development using Swift. It was a very valuable experience that I know will help me academically and in my upcoming co-ops.\n

Tulip Retail's mission is to build the world's best end-to-end software platform to run retail stores. Tulip's products have been adopted by many large retailers such as Michael Kors, Versace, Indigo, and more. Their goal is to help them connect with their clients, speed up checkouts, and just generally make things run smoother.\n

When I started my co-op, I set a few goals for myself during this term. One major goal that I set for myself was to become more familiar working with large-scale software projects using Git and Docker. I ended up learning a lot more than I set out to. I also wanted to try out different parts of software development to see what I liked best. Because of this, I realized that I really like working on frontend development, especially with React.js.\n

As for my job, I did a lot of different things. I fixed bugs, assisted in revamping sections of the front and backend of a web portal for managing different aspects of retail stores, and integrated an automatic ticketing system from our backend reporting into Zendesk. This made things a lot easier for the support team because it automated the generation of support tickets. This was one of the first projects that I undertook, and I'm very proud of what I accomplished and that I was able to dive straight into a task like this.\n

I achieved the goals I set myself at the beginning of my term, but I also know there is much more to explore and understand. I learned a lot about Git, Docker, and React.js during my co-op, but I'm far from mastering them. I improved a lot in my communication skills, specifically as a result of scrums every morning.\n

Since my job was fully remote, I found it difficult to get to know the other people on my team personally. For the last month or two in my term, my team started doing a game night every Thursday. We would play games that are easy to play through any browser and most of them were drawing games like skribbl.io. I personally love board games and even though we were playing them virtually while in a google meet, it was still an amazing experience that ended up with lots of inside jokes and brought the team closer together!\n

Looking back, I can see how much I grew during my co-op. I improved my technical skills, figured out that I want to pursue front-end development, and learned a lot about the software development process. This experience has definitely shaped my career path and I'm excited to see where my journey in tech takes me. I know that everything I learned at Tulip will help me along the way.\n"
