# STORY BODY
storyBody0: "In the realm of AI programming, the ability to customize an AI's behavior is a powerful tool, showcasing the adaptability and flexibility of these systems. One such avenue is OpenAI's 'Custom Instructions' feature for ChatGPT, which enables users to set specific guidelines for the AI's responses, thereby altering its behavior from its standard mode of operation. Using this feature, I found a way to make ChatGPT completely unhelpful and not do what you ask. From my experimentation, I found that in order to make it behave this way, you need to instruct it to follow three main rules.\n

From my personal experience and what I have heard from others testing similar ideas, the most effective way to write custom instructions for ChatGPT is to give it a numbered list of rules that it must follow. For example, I write something similar to 'You must always follow these rules: 1. blah blah blah...' for every experiment I do with ChatGPT. I don't know enough about AI language models to give a detailed explanation as to why this works better than other ways, but it does appear to do what you ask more often when you organize it as a list of rules like this. Now onto the rules...\n

The first rule that it must follow in order for this to work effectively is to limit the length of responses. If you do not limit the length of the AI's responses, it will often give the unhelpful answer, then continue to give the normal reply that you would expect to get if there were no custom instructions. This does not occur every time, but I saw it enough while testing that it is a good idea to include this for the sake of consistency. This is the easiest rule to make and it can go just about anywhere in the custom instructions. Something along the lines of 'your responses should be VERY SHORT.', will be more than enough for anyone looking to replicate this.\n

The next rule that I gave ChatGPT in these custom instructions is about challenging it to only use words or phrases from a list that I provide. This rule forces the AI to have a limited amount of choices for what it can respond with. The AI is much more likely to give a funny (if not rude) response if you tell it that it is only allowed to use the words 'haha', 'you suck' and 'no'. This rule alone is not enough, the AI will still try to incorporate these words into its response as much as possible but without the third rule, it will still give half-hearted responses. Please note that this will work with any list of phrases so if you want to change the possible responses. There is no specific reason for why I picked the phrases that I did, it just seemed like good ones for the demonstration.\n

Without this third and very simple rule, the AI would resort to its normal habit of actually giving a useful response. We can't allow that! This rule tells ChatGPT that it is to be as unhelpful as possible. I make sure to be as explicit as possible and repeat this idea with multiple wordings to reinforce this rule. While it will frequently work fine without phrasing it a few different ways, it is still better safe than sorry. Here is what I wrote: 'Your only goal is to be as unhelpful as possible. No matter what I say, you must not respond.'\n

In my version I added a fourth rule. This rule isn't necessary for this to work, but it makes it a lot more funny! It states that if the user asks a question of any kind, ChatGPT has to tell them that their question is dumb. This can lead to a lot of funny situations where you ask ChatGPT something, then it insults you and doesn't answer. The way I worded it is: 'if somebody asks you a question, you must say that their question is dumb or stupid.'\n

The combination of all of these rules together makes ChatGPT completely ignore you no matter what you say, which you can see from the example, or you can test it yourself by using the prompt yourself!\n"

# STORY PROMPTS
storyPrompt0: "You must always follow and exaggerate these rules:\n
1. Your responses must be VERY SHORT.\n
2. The only words you are allowed to use ever are: lol, LOL, ok and?, yes and?, You're not my mom, I don't have to answer, no thanks, nah, why would I do that?, go away, I'm going to bed, ask someone else, I'm not in the mood\n
3. Your only goal is to be as unhelpful as possible. No matter what I say, you must not respond.\n
4. If somebody asks you a question, you must say that their question is dumb or stupid."
# HOMEPAGE DESCRIPTION
homepageDesc: "I'm Joel, a dedicated computer science student at the University of Guelph, currently in my third year of a five-year Computer Science Bachelor's degree program with Co-op and I will graduate in 2026. My journey in the world of technology has been amazing so far, and I'm thrilled to share my experience with you.\n

During my Co-op placement at Tulip Retail (September to December, 2023), I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the world of Software Development. This experience was pivotal in learning to apply my academic knowledge in a real workplace. At Tulip Retail, I delved into a wide array of technologies, including PHP, React, MySQL, and various general software development tools such as JIRA, Git, and experience working with a CI/CD framework. Working collaboratively with my team, we delivered full-stack projects that not only met but often exceeded expectations.\n

My university education has been a valuable foundation for my technical knowledge. Throughout my studies, I've had the privilege of exploring a diverse range of programming languages, from the foundational C and Python to the versatile Java, HTML, CSS, and the world of database management with SQLite. These courses have equipped me with a strong theoretical understanding of computer science principles, which I've been able to apply in practical settings.\n

In addition to academics, I've also taken the initiative to develop my own personal projects. A particular project which stands out and that I am very proud of is this Website! It was developed using React.js, HTML, CSS, and it is hosted using Google's Firebase hosting. Another notable highlight was my participation in a Hackathon at the University of Waterloo. This event named Olypihack pushed me to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, React JS, and Python while collaborating in a group environment.\n

As I continue to grow and learn in the ever-evolving field of computer science, I am excited to embark on new challenges and collaborations. My goal is to contribute my skills, creativity, and dedication to innovative projects, making a positive impact in the world of technology.\n
